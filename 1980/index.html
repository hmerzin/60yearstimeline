      <p class="description" id="carterDescription">In 1980, shortly after China conducted an atmospheric nuclear test explosion

(which would end up being the worldâ€™s last such explosion), the United 

States began looking increasingly to monitoring and verification capacity as 

the lynchpin of nuclear agreements.</p>

        <p class="description" id="signingDescription">The signing of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty by the United States and the Soviet Union marked the first time the superpowers  agreed to reduce their nuclear arsenals, eliminate an entire category of nuclear weapons, and utilize  on-site inspections for verification.</p>

        <p class="description" id="description3">The INF Treaty's verification protocol certified reductions through a

combination of national technical means and on-site inspections.  States-

Parties' rights to conduct on-site inspections under the treaty ended in 2001, 

but the use of surveillance satellites and other National Technical Means for 

data collection continues.  The INF Treaty established the Special 

Verification Commission (SVC) to act as an implementing body for the 

treaty, resolving questions of compliance and agreeing on measures to 

improve its effectiveness.  <br/> <br/> Because the INF Treaty is of unlimited duration, 

states-parties can convene the SVC at any time, and the commission 

continues to meet as needed.</p>
