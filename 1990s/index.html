      <p class="description" id="description1">In 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which followed many of the precedents set by the INF Treaty, and adopted some measures from the SALT II Treaty, adding details that addressed some remaining uncertainties. <br/> <br/> START, like previous treaties, provided for extensive data exchange detailing the numbers and locations of affected weapons, and called for several types of on-site inspections, and allowed parties to conduct random, short-notice inspections of deployed missiles and heavy bombers. The Treaty entered into force in 1994.</p>

    <p class="description" id="flagDescription"> In 1993, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) launched efforts to strengthen NPT safeguards after secret nuclear weapons programs in Iraq and North Korea exposed weaknesses in the existing verification system. That effort  produced a voluntary Additional Protocol, designed to strengthen and expand existing IAEA safeguards authorities and practices to  ensure non-nuclear-weapon states-parties to the NPT use nuclear materials and facilities for peaceful purposes only. <br/> <br/>
 
Using its existing authority, the IAEA added new monitoring measures, such as environmental sampling, no-notice inspections at key measurement points within declared facilities, and remote monitoring and analysis. <br/> <br/>
 
The IAEA Model Additional Protocol, adopted in 1997, reshaped the IAEA's safeguards regime from a quantitative system focused on accounting for known quantities of materials and monitoring declared activities to a qualitative system aimed at gathering a comprehensive picture of a state's nuclear and nuclear-related activities, including all nuclear-related imports and exports. <br/> <br/> The Additional Protocol also substantially expands the IAEA's ability to check for clandestine nuclear facilities by providing the agency with authority to visit any facility, declared or not, to investigate questions about or inconsistencies in a state's nuclear declarations. The United States signed an Additional Protocol to its IAEA safeguards agreement in 1998 and the Senate provided its advice and consent to ratify it in March 2004. As of March 2016, 127 states have signed and ratified an Additional Protocol and another 19 States have signed an Additional Protocol but have yet to bring it into force.</p>

    <p class="description" id="secDescription">The 1995 NPT Review Conference resulted in three decisions and a

resolution as a “Package Deal.”  The first decision was to strengthen the 

review process with five-year review conferences, which would have 

committees and subsidiary bodies on specific issues, to provide for ongoing 

accountability. The second decision set out “principles and objectives” for 

assessing progress across all three core pillars of the NPT: disarmament, 

nonproliferation, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  The crucial third 

decision was to extend the treaty for an indefinite period.  A fourth decision 

was in the form of a resolution on a Middle East zone free of nuclear 

weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. <br/><br/> 

 

International support for the NPT remains strong.  The vast majority of states parties have upheld their obligations under the Treaty and adopted national policies and practices in line with the NPT Treaty’s purpose to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons and to pursue steps in the direction of eventual nuclear disarmament.  Review Conferences held every five years have not always produced agreement, reflecting differing priorities of parties and differing assessments of progress to meet the Treaty’s disarmament goals or to achieve its universality. <br/> <br/>

Negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament from 1994-96 led to the

conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which 

prohibits all nuclear explosions in all environments.  The Treaty calls for 

development of a verification regime consisting, inter alia, of the 

3 

International Monitoring System, composed of four monitoring 

technologies: seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound, and radionuclide, 

supported by the International Data Centre, along with provisions for on-site 

inspections once the Treaty is in force.</p>

    <p class="description" id="lastDescription"> On September 10, 1996, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a

resolution opening the CTBT for signature.  President Clinton signed the 

CTBT on the day it opened for signature, September 24, 1996, and by the 

end of that day 66 nations, including the four other NPT nuclear weapons 

states, had signed. <br/> <br/> On November 19, 1996, CTBT States Signatories established the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, inter alia, to establish the Treaty’s monitoring and verification regime.</p>
